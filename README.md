## About the language

> Describe the language

 Scala is a language that combines object-oriented and functional programming into a concise, high level language.
 It uses a strong statically typed system and is based on Java. However, it has a multitude of functions that are not
 available within java - most notably the functional programming support scala provides.
 
> - History

Development of the language started in 2001 in École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne by Martin Odersky. Inspired by 
previous languages such as Funnel, a language that combined functional programming and mathematical modeling of distributed systems,
Scala was created with an extensive support for functional programming and an aim to address the criticism that java faced. 

> - Some interesting features

Since its roots are based on both java and functional programming, Scala is a n object-oriented language which supports functional
programming concepts such as Lambda calculus, immutable data and "lazy" programming.

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```
